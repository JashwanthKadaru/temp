    "text": "Template Owner: Model Risk Management Template Last Updated: July\\. 2024 __Template Statement__ Model Owners are ultimately responsible for ensuring that model development and maintenance is properly documented—comprehensive and transparent enough that the model development process can be replicated by a knowledgeable third party\\. Model Owners often employ the assistance of other parties, such as the Model Developers and the Model Implementation Team, when writing the model development documentation\\. This template is designed to aid in the model development and maintenance documentation process for all models\\. The Model Owner should use judgment to determine if additional detail or elements not explicitly identified in this template should also be incorporated\\. The addition or removal of sections should be done at the discretion of the Model Owner, based on relevance to the model at hand and in accordance with the Model Risk Management Procedures\\. Guidelines \\(indicated in blue text throughout the document\\) have been provided to guide the writer regarding desired contents and writing style\\. Please note that these are merely suggestions and should only be included if applicable\\. __Documentation Scope__ The documentation requirements may vary depending on the model, for example depending on whether the model is internally\\- or externally\\-developed, as well as statistical or computational\\. Unless otherwise mentioned, this documentation requirement applies to all models\\. Model Information Info Content __Model ID__ *The ID number of the model starting with ‘MD\\_’ in model inventory* __Model Name__ *The exact model name in model inventory* __Model Version __ *Version of the model* __Model Owner__ *Model Owner name in model inventory* __Model Owner Contact Information__ *Model Owner email* __Model Sponsor of 1st LoD__ *Business Unit Model Sponsor name in model inventory* __Model Approver of 1st LoD__ *The individual who provides the approval for the model to be submitted for MRM validation\\.  The model approver can be Business Unit Model Sponsor or Model Owner’s manager\\. If Model Owner is VP level or above, Model Owner can also be the Model Approver\\.* __Model Approval Date__ *The date of the model approval is obtained* __Model Developer__ *Model Developer\\(s\\) name\\(s\\) in the model inventory* __Model Validator of 1LoD__ *Internal validator name\\(s\\), if applicable\\.* Document information Info Content __Document Author__ *The author\\(s\\) name\\(s\\) for this documentation* __Document Approver of 1st LoD__ *The Approver of the model development documentation can be Model Owner or Business Unit Model Sponsor\\.

Complete a new row of the table for each major revision to the document, typically occurring if the model itself has changed, or the documentation has been modified\\. Judgment should be applied to determine whether a change is major or minor \\(i\\.e\\., V1\\.1 or V2\\.0, respectively\\)\\. For the first draft of the model documentation, please list as ‘initial version’ with version number 1\\.0\\.
